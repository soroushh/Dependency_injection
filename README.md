## In this project, I am trying to learn how to imply dependency injection.

In order to be able to test the classes dependently, we
should be able to use doubles to mock them out and test the behaviour of each class in its own, not in other classes.

In this project, different classes are tested separately and doubles are used to do that.

You can find the instructions and exercises in the following url:
